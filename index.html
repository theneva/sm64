    <h2>Game</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>JP</dt>
      <dd>
        Japanese version of the game. Unlike the English version, the Japanese
        version does not feature voice acting for Peach's letter during the
        intro cutscene; text boxes scroll slightly slower; MIPS moves slightly
        faster; and some stars that are located inside boxes in the English
        version are out in the open.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Categories</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>120 Star</dt>
      <dd>
        A 100 % completion of the game. Starts when the console is powered on,
        and ends when the Grand Star is touched after defeating BitS.
      </dd>
      <dt>70 Star</dt>
      <dd>
        The minimum number of stars required to beat the game without exploting
        glitches during Castle Movement. Starts when the console is powered on,
        and ends when the Grand Star is touched after defeating BitS.
      </dd>
      <dt>16 Star</dt>
      <dd>
        Any% without SBLJ. LBLJ is used to bypass the 8 Star Door. 15 stars are
        required to spawn MIPS, which is used to clip through the 30 Star Door
        (see MIPS Clip). The first star in DDD is required to unlock Fire Sea.
        After defeating Fire Sea, BLJs are used to bypass the 50 Star Door and
        the Infinite Staircase. Starts when the console is powered on, and ends
        when the Grand Star is touched after defeating BitS.
      </dd>
      <dt>0 Star, 1 Star</dt>
      <dd>
        Any%. The shortest RTA (real-time action) category. LBLJ is used to
        bypass the 8 Star Door. SBLJ is used to bypass the 30 Star Door, which
        (given enough speed) can bypass DDD and send the player to Fire Sea
        without unlocking it (0 star), or (given too little speed) can send the
        player into DDD, forcing them to collect the first star to unlock Fire
        Sea (1 star). BLJ is used to bypass the 50 Star Door and the Infinite
        Staircase. Starts when the console is powered on, and ends when the
        Grand Star is touched after defeating BitS.
      </dd>
      <dt>1 key</dt>
      <dd>
        Any%. TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) only, as it makes use of extremely
        precise input to enter Basement without defeating Dark World.
      </dd>
      <dt>30 Star</dt>
      <dd>
        Collect any 3 stars from every stage, plus keys from the Bowser Stages.
        The 50 Star Door and Infinite Staircase are bypassed with BLJs. Starts
        when the console is powered on, and ends when the Grand Star is touched
        after defeating BitS.
      </dd>
      <dt>Nonstop</dt>
      <dd>
        A version of the game where Mario is not ejected from the painting after
        collecting each star. Starts when the console is powered on, and ends
        when the Grand Star is touched after defeating BitS.
      </dd>
      <dt>Randomizer</dt>
      <dd>
        A version of the game where almost every object's position is random
        (within its original Loading Zone), and each painting leads to a
        different Stage. Starts when selecting the new save file, and ends when
        the Grand Star is touched after defeating BitS.

      <dd>
        A jump into a wall at speed (most commonly by accident), losing all of
        Mario's speed and being knocked back by the wall. Falling off a ledge
        during this knock-back prevents Mario from getting up, and may lead to

      <dt>Speed Kick</dt>
      <dd>
        A kick during a jump (B button press while airborne with too low
